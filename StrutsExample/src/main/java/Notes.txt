In this tutorial we show you how to develop a hello world web application using classic Struts 1.3 framework.

Tools and technologies used :
Struts 1.3.10
Maven 3.x
Eclipse 3.6

1. Maven Template
   Generate a   Maven project.
   
2. pom.xml file configuration
   Add the Struts dependencies in pom.xml. In Struts 1.x, you need the struts-core.jar for core module and 
   struts-taglib.jar for tag library.


3. Action Form//form bean class
   Create a Struts Action Form to hold the “hello world” data later.

4. Action (Controller)
   Create a Struts Action (Action Controller) file to control how Struts will forward the request, 
   just override the execute() method with your own logic here.
   
5. JSP view page
   Create a JSP page and access the Action Form object via Struts tag library and print it’s message property.
   

6. struts-config.xml
   Create a struts-config.xml file for the Struts configuration details, and put it into the WEB-INF folder.
   
7. The Web Application Deployment Descriptor
   In web.xml file, configure the Struts ActionServlet instance and map it with url-pattern “*.do”, 
   so that the container is aware of all the “*.do” pattern will redirect to Struts ActionServlet.
   
   
   
   
   
8. Java EE Module dependency (Optional)
   If you want to do the debugging work in Eclipse IDE, you have to make sure the Java EE module dependencies is 
   checked so that the Eclipse will deploy all the dependencies into correct folder. See details here.

9. Run it
   In Eclipse IDE, create a new server plugin and start it. You can access this example in the following URL.
